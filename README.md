# RaspControl
GUI running on the Raspberry PI

Hello, this is Michael.
To run the program use the command: python raspController.py

It is the bare GUI, no functionality yet :). It has a few dependencies and you'll to download them on your Raspberry PI.
1. sudo apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools
2. sudo apt-get install python-qt4
3. sudo apt-get update
4. sudo apt-get upgrade

The password is stored in cript.xml, you can change it from there.

I hope you get no errors! If you do, contact me ;)
